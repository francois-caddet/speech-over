# SpeechOver

A modern screen reader for linux writen in rust.


## Build

The recomanded way to build it is using nix:

```bash
nix build
```

Anyway it's a rust only program so it can be build by:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Install

Do not make sens to install it now. It's more than early and does not eaven build sometimes.

## Contribute

I don't accept contribution at this moment. It's too early.
Anyway, if you want to hack it, you can perform `nix develop`.
